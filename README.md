This repository helps you find some contents related to the linear regression with one variale

# Detail:
In this this exercise, you will implement linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck. Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities. You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next.

# Dataset:
Our data is a csv file called ex1data1.csv.
The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss. Please note that in this program all data has been considered as training data

# Prerequisite:
  1) jupyter notebook
  2) Pandas pakage
  3) Numpy pakage
  4) matplot pakage
  5) some information about linear regression

# Main file
The main file is Ex1_Part1.ipynb, including several functions to give a good result


# Defined functions used in Ex1_Part1.ipynb
1-load_csv_data is used to load data and determine usfule variables from the file ex1data1.csv 
2-cost_function is used to find the optimized theta and cost function for the problem using gradient descent algorithem
3-visualize_2d_graphs is used to visulize our data and the whole process of gradient descent. This file hepls you draw the regression line, cost_function trend, 3d cost function and 2d contour plot.
